# Client-Server

## Dev Instructions
Remember to add the javax.mail.jar to your list of referenced libraries when working.
In VS Code, you accomplish this by opening the "Java Projects" section in the explorer window.
Open the "Client-Server-Architecture" tab, and then at the bottom is "Referenced Libraries."
When you hover over it, you see a plus button that if you click allows you to add the library.
